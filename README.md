A web application built to address the Sustainable Development Goal(SDG) 7, which is to provide access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. Sri Lanka is facing significant challenges in the energy sector. Clean energy access remains a major issue, compounded by the current economic crisis and high inflation rates. In order to address these problems, the web application provides functionalities such as;
